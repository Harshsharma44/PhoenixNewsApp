I have built this app using the News API from newsapi.org website and used to complete the given task

Here are some points before using the app effectively:

1. The app won't show news on the college lan as the API will never work due to kind restrictions by the respected server room of our college ;).
2. Search Bar is implemented and working 
3. Special Note is that a stable internet connection is a must in order to get the API working properly . 
4. Webview is working as tested on several mobile phones.
5. Android version less than 3 years can have some unstable behaviour 


Thanks for Checking this out :) .
